# Incremental V1.3
    Thank you for visiting this repository of my Incremental game. This is an html game, with css & js.
    This game took me a couple of months to finish & upload. More is definitely coming to this game.
    And feel free to critique me, I have only been coding for 2 years now (Mainly html, css, & js). Well, have a good day now :)
    
    If you don't know what the point of an Incremental is or you just don't know what it is, an Incremental is a clicker game.
    You usually click something to gain some type of currency. With that currency, you buy upgrades which is can help you get
    more of that currency. Think of it like Cookie Clicker (I hope you've played it)
