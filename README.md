### i'm remaking the entire game again. so development might take a bit longer now. but ive decided that i could make the game better if i just do it from scratch again. also because i couldnt fix the animation bug :)

## Incremental v2.0.0
As in v2.0.0, the point of this game is to just click! The amount of clicks you have / get is your currency.
With that, you can buy upgrades while getting achievements!

## Running Requirements
You only need a browser that can run HTML5, CSS3, & JS ES6. In short, just make sure that your browser can run the main web languages.

**_So, i'll be honest. the versioning is most likely really bad. please excuse it. i'm a rookie when it comes to stuff like this, especially with github._**
**_the struggle is very real :(_**
